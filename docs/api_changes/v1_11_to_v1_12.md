## API changes from 1.10 to 1.12

libUPnP version 1.12 contains some API changes compared to v1.10, this page
contains explanation of these changes and what users need to do to migrate
from using 1.10 to 1.12.

### list.h header changed

The `list.h` header was replace by a different version, now all symbols
are properly namespaced with a Upnp prefix. This header was never intended
to be used directly by libUPnP users, so not many should be affected.

As a side-effect of the header change, libUPnP no longer defines the
`true` and `bool` macros. Users that need those should define their
own or use `<stdbool.h>`. Additionally the following macros are no
longer defined:
- `prefetch`
- `container_of`
- `READ_ONCE`
- `WRITE_ONCE`

And various list-specific macros are gone.
